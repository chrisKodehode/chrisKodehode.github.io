            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
            the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
            of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
            (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
            between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes.

      <p class="explore-textp">
        The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
        and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.

        Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day 
        temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C).Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can 
        dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
              
        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to 
        nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 
        Earth days.

                Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system – traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. 
                The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, 
                it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system – 88 days.

          Named for the fleet-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury is the closest
          planet to the sun, zipping around our parent star at an average of 36
          million miles away. However, Mercurys orbit is not a perfect circle.
          The planet can pass as close as 29 million miles and as far away as 43
          million miles. Living up to its name, Mercury is the fastest planet in
          the solar system, speeding along at about 29 miles per second and
          completing each orbit around the sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury is
          also the smallest planet in the solar system, measuring just 3,032 miles
          wide at its equator. That makes it only slightly larger than Earths
          moon. Because Mercury is so small and so close to the sun, it is the
          most elusive of the five planets that are visible to the naked eye. You
          can only catch Mercury at dawn and dusk, and it usually does not rise
          far above the horizon. But thats not the only time the tiny planet
          makes an appearance. Because of its position in the solar system,
          Mercury passes between Earth and the sun 13 times each century in an
          event known as a transit. During a transit of Mercury, observers on
          Earth can see the planet in silhouette as it seems to sweep across the
          suns disk.
