      <h1>About mercury picture</h1>
      <p>
        Named for the fleet-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury is the closest
        planet to the sun, zipping around our parent star at an average of 36
        million miles away. However, Mercury’s orbit is not a perfect circle.
        The planet can pass as close as 29 million miles and as far away as 43
        million miles. Living up to its name, Mercury is the fastest planet in
        the solar system, speeding along at about 29 miles per second and
        completing each orbit around the sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury is
        also the smallest planet in the solar system, measuring just 3,032 miles
        wide at its equator. That makes it only slightly larger than Earth’s
        moon. Because Mercury is so small and so close to the sun, it is the
        most elusive of the five planets that are visible to the naked eye. You
        can only catch Mercury at dawn and dusk, and it usually does not rise
        far above the horizon. But that’s not the only time the tiny planet
        makes an appearance. Because of its position in the solar system,
        Mercury passes between Earth and the sun 13 times each century in an
        event known as a transit. During a transit of Mercury, observers on
        Earth can see the planet in silhouette as it seems to sweep across the
        sun’s disk.
